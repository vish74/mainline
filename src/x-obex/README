What are these files for?
=========================

These are meant for helper scripts that want to handle
advanced obex features. Compiling without -DAPP gives
you object files that you can use in your program
(GPLv2 applies).

obex-capability:
  Create an OBEX capability object.
  Currently, it only creates required elements.

obex-folder-listing:
  Create an OBEX folder listing object.
  You _must_ be in the root folder (from the OBEX client's view
  not the real root directory) and use a relative path or
  use a chroot or equivalent with absolute paths.
  Having ".." in the path is not allowed (use a chroot and "readlink -f"
  in that case), only regular files and directories are displayed.


How do I use them in a program?
===============================

For linked usage:
See the header files. You can use your systems tmpfile() function
to create a safe temporary file that the functions can use.

For usage as programs:
All output goes to stdout, so you can use pipes or redirections.


Where are the DTD files?
========================

The DTDs are only printed in the IrOBEX specification which
is not free to copy.
Thus, the DTDs are not freely available.
They are not actually needed, though.
