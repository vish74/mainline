Requirements:
=============

You need the development files for:
openobex >= 1.1 (> 1.3 recommended)
bluez-lib

You also must have installed:
cmake (>= 2.6.0)
pkg-config
xmlto


Building:
=========

CMake is used for building. In the simplest form, you create a binary directory
somewhere e.g. as ./build, change to that directory and run:
$ cmake ..

where ".." is the relative path to the source directory.
If you want to change the installation location to "/usr", define the cmake
variable CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX with the -D command line option:
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..

You can also use one of the provided interactive front-end to change project
options:
$ ccmake .

or as replacement for the cmake calls above (see documentation of ccmake).

This will create Makefiles and thus you can run:
$ make


Build options:
==============

Build options are set with CMake variables by adding -DFOO=bar to the cmake command
line ot set variable 'FOO' to the value 'var'.
Boolean values take the values 'ON' or 'OFF'.

The following build options are available:
USE_SPAWN         Use POSIX function spawn() (instead of fork()+exec()) for external
                  scripts. The default is ON and this is also the suggested value.
USE_THREADS       Use POSIX threads (instead of fork()) for client connections. The
                  default in ON and this is also the suggested value.
BUILD_XOBEX_LIBS  Build libraries to handle xobex/* mime types in your own programs.
                  Default if OFF and the binaries are linked statically.

There are lots of other variables that affect the build.

Installing:
===========

Run:
$ make install

You can optionally define the DESTDIR variable like
$ make install DESTDIR=/path/to/some/dir


Using:
======

See "obexpushd -h" for help and take a look at the README file.
There is also a manpage.
