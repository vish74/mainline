Requirements:
=============

You need the development files for:
openobex [>= 1.1 required, >= 1.5 recommended]
bluez-lib

You also must have installed:
cmake [>= 2.6.3]

Optionally you may also install:
pkg-config (to find libraries more easily)
xsltproc or saxon-6.5.x or xalan-2.x (to build documentation)
Docbook XSL files (or the online catalogs will be used)
TCP-Wrapper (to restrict TCP connections)
Gcrypt library (for MD5 and NONCE instead of internal code)


Building:
=========

CMake is used for building. In the simplest form, you create a binary directory
somewhere e.g. as ./build, change to that directory and run:
$ cmake ..

where ".." is the relative path to the source directory.
If you want to change the installation location to "/usr", define the cmake
variable CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX with the -D command line option:
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..

You can also use one of the provided interactive front-ends:
$ ccmake ..
or
$ cmake-gui ..

as replacement for the cmake calls above (see documentation of ccmake).

This will create Makefiles and thus you can build the software:
$ make


Build options:
==============

Build options are set with CMake variables by adding -DFOO=bar to the cmake
command line ot set variable 'FOO' to the value 'var'.
Boolean values take the values 'ON' or 'OFF'.

The following build options are available:
USE_SPAWN
    Use POSIX function spawn() (instead of fork()+exec()) for external scripts.
    The default is ON and this is also the suggested value.

USE_THREADS
    Use POSIX threads (instead of fork()) for client connections. The default is
    ON and this is also the suggested value.

USE_LIBGCRYPT
    Enable usage of the gcrypt library if found. The default is ON.

ENABLE_TCPWRAP
    Enable support for the tcp wrapper (see /etc/host.deny and /etc/hosts.allow)

BUILD_HELP_HTML
    Build the HTML help files. Default is OFF.

BUILD_HELP_MAN
    Build the manpage files. Default is ON

BUILD_X_OBEX_SHARED_LIBS
    Build libraries to handle x-obex/* mime types in your own programs. Default
    if OFF and the x-obex binaries are linked statically.

DOCBOOK_XSLT_PROCESSOR
    Choose the XSLT processor to use for creating of the help file. Supported
    are xsltproc, saxon-6.5.x and xalan-2.x. The default is set automatically
    from the list of installed ones.

DOCUMENTATION_INSTALL_DIR
    Choose the location where documentation gets installed (example, html help
    files, ...). Defaults to share/doc/obexpushd.

MANPAGE_INSTALL_DIR
    Choose the location where manual pages get installed.
    Defaults to share/man.

There are lots of other variables that affect the build.


Installing:
===========

Run:
$ make install

You can optionally define the DESTDIR variable like
$ make install DESTDIR=/path/to/some/dir


Using:
======

See "obexpushd -h" for help and take a look at the README file.
There is also a manpage.
