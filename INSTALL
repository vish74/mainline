Requirements:
=============

You need the development files for:
openobex >= 1.1 (> 1.3 recommended)
bluez-lib

You also must have installed:
cmake (>= 2.4.7)
pkg-config
xmlto


Building:
=========

CMake is used for building. In the simplest form, you create a binary directory
somewhere e.g. as ./build, change to that directory and run:
$ cmake ..

where ".." is the relative path to the source directory.
If you want to change the installation location to "/usr", define the cmake
variable CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX with the -D command line option:
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..

You can also use one of the provided interactive front-end to change project
options:
$ ccmake .

or as replacement for the cmake calls above (see documentation of ccmake).

This will create Makefiles and thus you can run:
$ make


Build options:
==============

The following build options (== cmake variables) are available:
USE_SPAWN     Use POSIX function spawn() (instead of fork()+exec()) for external
              scripts. The default is ON and this is also the suggested value.
USE_THREADS   Use POSIX threads (instead of fork()) for client connections. The
              default in ON and this is also the suggested value.


Installing:
===========

Run:
$ make install

You can optionally define the DESTDIR variable like
$ make install DESTDIR=/path/to/some/dir


Using:

See "obexpushd -h" for help and take a look at the README file.
There is also a manpage.
