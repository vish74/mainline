Starting the OBEX-Push service
==============================

Simply run:
$ obexpushd

It will automatically listen on bluetooth as nothing was specified.
If you also want it to listen to default IrDA identifier, run:
$ obexpushd -B -I

If your remote device sends files with the "OBEX:IrXfer"
identifier instead of using the "OBEX" identifier, you can
_additionally_ listen to it:
$ obexpush -B -IIrXfer


Stopping the OBEX-Push service
==============================

I suggest to run:
$ pkill -u $USER obexpushd

As an alternative, let obexpushd create a pidfile and use that:
$ kill $(cat pidfile)

Note that it will not automatically be killed when you log out!


Why does another OBEX-Push listener get the files?
=================================================

This can not be influenced as it depends on the sending entity.
Usually, the service with the lower channel is contacted.
Obexpushd uses channel 9 by default but you can change that:
$ obexpushd -B3

will listen to channel 3 instead of channel 9.
You can check local service with
$ sdptool browse local

Some versions of Bluez contain a buggy SDP server that does not
deregister entries on disconnect or close, automatically. However,
some programs rely on that previously working and documented behaviour,
e.g. kdebluetooth. As a work-around, either do not use those programs
or restart the SDP server after doing so.
Bluez-3.36 is known to fix those problem, thus it is _strongly_
suggested to use this version. Since this bluez version also ships a
obex-data-server, this may conflict with running obexpushd.


Where does it save the files to?
================================

The files are stored in the directory where you start it.


Some files are not stored, what happens?
========================================

The file may already exist. Existing files are not overwritten.
Start obexpushd in non-detached mode (option -n) to see what
happens.


My OBEX client hardware does not work with obexpushd.
How can I see what is going wrong?
=====================================================

First start obexpushd with the debug mode (option -d). You may
additionally start a dump program for your bit transport layer:
bluetooth: hcidump
irda: irdadump
tcp: tcpdump or wireshark

The combination makes it often possible to see where a problem may be.
A comparison with a working hardware makes it even easier.


Even in debug mode, nothing happens when sending with bluetooth.
================================================================

Make sure that ISCAN and PSCAN are enabled for your blueooth dongle.
With bluez, hciconfig is the tool to take a look at the current
settings (root only) or via DBUS.
Working settings for bluez-3.xx:
* install bluez-utils (especially hcid)
* configure hcid.conf and set (some options have alternative
  settings that also work):
      options {
          autoinit yes;
          security auto;
          passkey "0000";
          pairing multi;
      }
      device {
          class 0x3e0100
          iscan enable;
          pscan enable;
          discovto 0;
          lm accept;
      }
* remove /var/lib/bluetooth/*/config (with /var/lib/bluetooth being the
  runtime configuration directiory)
* restart hcid
