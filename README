Starting the OBEX-Push service
==============================

Simply run
$ obexpushd

It will automatically listen on bluetooth as nothing was specified.
If you also want tot listen to default IrDA identifier:
$ obexpushd -B -I

If your remote device sends files with the "OBEX:IrXfer"
identifier instead of using the "OBEX" identifier, you can
_additionally_ listen to it:
$ obexpush -B -IIrXfer


Stopping the OBEX-Push service
==============================

I suggest to run:
$ pkill -u $USER obexpushd

As an alternative, let obexpushd create a pidfile and use that:
$ kill $(cat pidfile)

Note that it will not automatically be killed when you log out!


Why does another OBEX-Push listener get the files?
=================================================

This can not be influenced as it depends on the sending entity.
Usually, the service with the lower channel is contacted.
Obexpushd uses channel 9 by default but you can change that:
$ obexpushd -B3

will listen to channel 3 instead of channel 9.
You can check local service with
$ sdptool browse local


Where does it save the files to?
================================

The files are stored in the directory where you start it.


Some files are not stored, what happens?
========================================

The file may already exist. Existing files are not overwritten.
Start obexpushd in non-detached mode (option -n) to see what
happens.
